# Custom-Cursor-mini-project

## Summary
In this mini project I am modeling how to create and alter custom cursors. I built the custom cursor and click animation to be rudimentary by design to maintain focus on the code functionality. HTML and CSS  files included, JS file is annotated with comments to walk you through the steps. Codepen link included below. If you like my work or you learned something, star this repo!

## User Story
- The custom cursor should be displayed on page load.
- The custom cursor follows user mouse movement.
- The custom cursor follows user scroll movement.
- The user has the choice to switch between the custom cursor and the default cursor by clicking respective button.
- Only 1 (select) cursor style can be displayed at any given time.
- The default cursor will display a pointer-cursor when hovering a button, but the custom cursor will not.
- When a click is made using the custom cursor, a click animation performs.
- The click animation is repeated on every click when using the custom cursor.
